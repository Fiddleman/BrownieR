#' take_screenshot(), Takes screenshots of URLs
#'
#' Takes screenshots of all URLs passed to the function arguments and saves them in a new folder
#' screenshots in the working directory. The filename is the url modified by the function
#' \code{link{url_to_filename}}.
#'
#' To get precise heatmaps with the function \code{link{plot_brownie}} it is indispensable to
#' set the width of the screenshots right. It's recommended to evalualte the max.pos in the data
#' before taking screenshots. Moreover, when executing the funciton \code{link{plot_brownie}} will
#' use the files saved in the folder screenshots.
#'
#' @param URLs a character vector; URLs must be full qualified containing schema (http or https)
#' @param width a numeric; width of screenshots in pixel. The width must be the width of the browser
#' viewport during the experiment!
#' @return vector of screenshot file names that where taken and saved in ./screenshots/
#' @examples
#' take_screenshot(c("https://www.visualvest.de/", "https://www.visualvest.de/angebot/", "https://www.visualvest.de/team/"), width = 1000)
